                        I am a Computer programmer and analyst who has experience with various programming 
                        languages such as C#, JavaScript, Python and SQL, along with different programs and 
                        tools like SQL server, Microsoft Visual Studio, Azure Data Studio, Microsoft Power BI,

                        <br>
                        I am currently in my final term as a student at Niagara College and am enrolled in 
                        the Computer
                        Programming and Analysis program. During my time in this program, I have learned to 
                        work effectively with a team, and I have gained hands on experience planning, 
                        designing and coding web sites and applications, as well as creating, managing and 
                        analyzing Databases.

                        In my personal life, I enjoy working with computers, as well as reading, playing 
                        videogames, and doing sports.
